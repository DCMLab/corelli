It was relased together with and as part of the &quot;workflow paper&quot;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hentschel, J., Moss, F. C., Neuwirth, M., &amp; Rohrmeier, M. A. (2021). A semi-automated workflow paradigm for the distributed creation and curation of expert annotations. Proceedings of the 22nd International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference, ISMIR, 262&ndash;269. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.5624417\">https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.5624417</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The corpus comprises 36 <code>Sonate a tre</code>, divided into 149 separate movements. Together they make up for three of the four famous cycles of 12 trio sonatas each:</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Opus</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Cycle</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Publication</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Included</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>12 sonate da chiesa</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Rome 1681</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Yes</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t<td>12 sonate da camera</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Rome 1685</td>\n\t\t\t<td>No</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t\t<td>12 sonate da chiesa</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Rome 1689</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Yes</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t<td>12 sonate da camera</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Rome 1694</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Yes</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><strong>Version 1.0</strong> reflects the state of the dataset when finalizing chapter 4 of the workflow paper cited above.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Version 1.1</strong> marks the moment where all 149 movements include a reviewed set of annotations that adhere to version 2.3.0 of the <a href=\"https://github.com/DCMLab/standards\">DCML harmony annotation standard</a>. The metadata have not been completed yet and the data were extracted one last time with the now deprecated version 0.4.11 of the <a href=\"https://github.com/johentsch/ms3\">MuseScore parser ms3</a> for matters of completeness and homogeneity. The purpose is mainly to substantiate the claim that the &quot;semi-annotated workflow paradigm&quot;, as it had been implemented at publication time (see the ISMIR paper cited above), can indeed be put to effective use in the creation of a large dataset. This version is, however, to be followed by a version with upgraded tabular data based on the more mature ms3 &gt; 1.0.0.</p>",
