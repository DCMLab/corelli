============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 13, '1/2', 'V2') ms3.Parse.corelli.op04n06g
	The label 'V2' in m. 13, onset 1/2 (MC 13, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of E.I, it expresses the scale degrees
	('4', '5', '7', '2') [('A', 'B', 'D#', 'F#')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 1 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 26, '1/4', 'iii7') ms3.Parse.corelli.op04n06g

	('3', 'b5', '7', 'b2') [('G', 'Bb', 'D', 'F')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 5 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
