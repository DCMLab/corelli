Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review
============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 15, '7/8', 'iv') ms3.Parse.corelli.op03n10b
	The label 'iv' in m. 15, onset 7/8 (MC 15, onset 7/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of a.III, it expresses the scale degrees
	('4', 'b6', '1') [('F', 'Ab', 'C')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.

	('7', '1', '4') [('G', 'A', 'D')].
	The corresponding score segment has 3 within-label and 5 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.625 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
