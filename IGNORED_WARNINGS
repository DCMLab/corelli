	The upper two staves are in 12/8, the lower two in 2/2.
	This is indeed problematic because the computes positions do not overlap between the two pairs of staves.
	As a solution, 12/8 should be rewritten as triples in 2/2.

	The upper two staves are in 12/8, the lower two in 4/4.
	This is indeed problematic because the computes positions do not overlap between the two pairs of staves.
	As a solution, 12/8 should be rewritten as triples in 4/4.
